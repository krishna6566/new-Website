<p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of 
berries from certain Coffea species. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked,
processed, and dried.Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roa-
ted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are
ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage 
known as coffee.</p>

<p>Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating 
effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the 
most popular drinks in the world,[3] and it can be prepared and presented 
in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte). It is 
usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative.</p>
