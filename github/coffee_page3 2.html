<p>The whole coffee beans are ground, also known as milling, to facilitate 
the brewing process.</p>

<p>The fineness of the grind strongly affects brewing. Brewing methods that 
expose coffee grounds to heated water for longer require a coarser grind 
than faster brewing methods. Beans that are too finely ground for the 
brewing method in which they are used will expose too much surface area to
the heated water and produce a bitter, harsh, "over-extracted" taste. At 
the other extreme, an overly coarse grind will produce weak coffee unless 
more is used. Due to the importance of a grind's fineness, a uniform grind
is highly desirable.</p>

<P>If a brewing method is used in which the time of exposure of the ground 
coffee to the heated water is adjustable, then a short brewing time can be
used for finely ground coffee. This produces coffee of equal flavor yet 
uses less ground coffee. A blade grinder does not cause frictional heat 
buildup in the ground coffee unless used to grind very large amounts as 
in a commercial operation. A fine grind allows the most efficient extra-
ction but coffee ground too finely will slow down filtration or 
screening.</p>

Ground coffee deteriorates faster than roasted beans because of the great
-er surface area exposed to oxygen. Many coffee drinkers grind the beans 
themselves immediately before brewing.

Spent coffee grinds can be reused for hair care or skin care as well as 
in the garden. These can also be used as biodiesel fuel.[1]

There are four methods of grinding coffee for brewing: burr-grinding, 
chopping, pounding, and roller grinding.

<section>
<h3>Burr-grinding</h3>
<p>Burr grinders are of two types - conical burrs and flat wheel burrs.Both
of them grind coffee bean consistently and with uniform size.Almost every
burr coffee grinder grinds at low noise, offer large hopper for storing 
whole coffee bean, easy to use with portafilter for espresso grind, body
made with stainless steel or ceramic with modern design as well as slow 
operating system ensures find grind all the time.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Chopping</h3>
<p>Coffee beans can be chopped by using blades rotating at high speed 
(20,000 to 30,000 rpm), either in a blade grinder designed specifically 
for coffee and spices, or in a general use home blender. Devices of this
sort are cheaper than burr grinders, but the grind is not uniform and 
will produce particles of widely varying sizes,while ideally all particles
should have the same size, appropriate for the method of brewing. More-
over, the particles get smaller and smaller during the grinding process,
which makes it difficult to achieve a consistent grind from batch to 
batch.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>Arabic coffee and Turkish coffee require that the grounds be almost 
powdery in fineness, finer than can be achieved by most burr grinders. 
Pounding the beans with a mortar and pestle can pulverise the coffee finely
enough.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Roller grinding</h3>
<p>In a roller grinder, the beans are ground between pairs of corrugated
rollers. A roller grinder produces a more even grind size distribution 
and heats the ground coffee less than other grinding methods. However, 
due to their size and cost,roller grinders are used exclusively by 
commercial and industrial scale coffee producers.</p>
